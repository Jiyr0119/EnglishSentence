# Persistence

# Promises are often like the butterfly, which disappear after beautiful hover.
承诺常常很像蝴蝶，美丽的盘旋后就不见了。

# Fading is true while flowering is past.
凋谢是真实的，盛开只是一种过去。

# some things are not see to insist,but insist the will see hope.
有些事不是看到希望才去坚持，而是坚持了才会看到希望。

# Home is not where you live but where they understand you.
栖身之所不一定是家，有人懂你之处才是家。

# Don't be afraid of the darkness.Don't be afraid to chase your dreams.Don't be afraid to be yourself.Follow your own path.
不要害怕黑暗，不要害怕追寻自己的梦想，不要害怕做与众不同的自己，走你自己的路。
